# Telegram to RAG LLM Checklist

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Telegram Bot Receives Audio Message**
   - User sends an audio message to the Telegram bot.
   - The bot captures the audio file and forwards it for transcription.

2. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - Use a speech-to-text service (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper) to transcribe the audio.
   - The transcription result is processed to ensure clarity and accuracy.

3. **Retrieve and Generate (RAG) LLM Interaction**
   - The transcribed text is sent to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Language Model.
   - The RAG LLM retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and generates contextually relevant responses or insights.

4. **Generate a Checklist**
   - Based on the LLM's output, create a structured checklist.
   - This checklist includes actionable items derived from the context of the transcription and LLM response.

5. **Send Checklist Back to User**
   - The checklist is formatted for readability.
   - The Telegram bot sends the checklist back to the user, completing the workflow.
